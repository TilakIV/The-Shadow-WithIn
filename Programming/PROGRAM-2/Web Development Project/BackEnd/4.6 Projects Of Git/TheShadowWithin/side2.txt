Maybe the story was not over yet. After being betrayed by his friend, the hero chose a different path in life.
Struggles awaited him,
and unaware of the dangers ahead, he stepped into the ruthless world of the race. He was a fine 
contenderâ€”a strong horse with great potential.

But as time passed, the hero fell into bad habits and surrounded himself with a toxic circle. Slowly, he let his light dim. The hero, once full of promise,
began walking the path of a villain. However, as they say, "a horse with a broken leg is worth nothing." His choices led him to become that broken horse, 
unable to keep up with the race he had entered.
Years passed, and the hero, now weighed down by his decisions,
lost the race he once had the strength to win. The story ended not in glory, but in regret.
