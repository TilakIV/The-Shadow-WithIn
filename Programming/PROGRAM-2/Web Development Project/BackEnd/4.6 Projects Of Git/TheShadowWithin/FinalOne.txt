It was a false prophecy that the hero would fail—for he was no ordinary man. He was a force, a beacon of unyielding strength,
 a leader forged by fire, and a soul born of boundless potential. As the ancients whispered, he carried within him the essence
  of the universe itself, every fragment of cosmic energy coursing through his veins. He was the one who held all power, the one
   who possessed infinite knowledge, the eternal force that transcends time and space.

He was matter, indestructible and eternal. He was energy, limitless and uncontainable. He was not bound by what he appeared 
to be—he was nothing, yet he was everything. He was the origin and the end, the void and the whole, the chaos and the harmony.
 He was complete—a being beyond comprehension, a manifestation of all that exists and all that will ever be.
