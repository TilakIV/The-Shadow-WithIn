Once upon a time, a 17-year-old boy met a girl of the same age whose beauty left him in awe.
But the girl paid him no attention. What could have been a beautiful love story took a tragic turn when
fate introduced a masked villain disguised as the boy's friend.

The villain, clever and deceitful, played a dual game.
He painted himself as the hero and twisted the boy's image into that of a villain. The girl,
unaware of the truth, trusted the masked pretender and chose him, unknowingly compromising the
true hero who had cared for her all along.
